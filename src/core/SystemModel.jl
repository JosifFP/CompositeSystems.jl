"""
Define a "SystemModel" structure to represent a power system model.
The structure is parametrized by:
 - N - The number of time steps or periods
 - L - Duration or related parameter
 - T - Period (i.e., a time-based unit such as second, minute, etc.)
Fields:
- `loads`: Load profile of the system across various nodes and time periods.
- `generators`: Generators in the system, defined across nodes and periods.
- `storages`: Energy storage units in the system, across nodes and periods.
- `buses`: Bus structure defining connection points in the network.
- `branches`: Branches defining interconnections or transmission lines.
- `commonbranches`: Specialized set of branches with shared/common attributes or behavior.
- `shunts`: Shunts, usually devices used to adjust voltage or to phase-shift load currents.
- `baseMVA`: Base apparent power (used for per unit system calculations in power systems).
- `timestamps`: Timestamps defining the different time periods the system is modeled over.

Constructor:
Ensures that provided timestamps, if any, match the expected step and count before creating an instance.
